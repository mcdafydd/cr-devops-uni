# Setup Tools

We will start by installing and configuring a set of common tools that will enable you to complete all of the lessons on this site.  These tools are merely a suggestion that the documentation and exercises can target to communicate about a topic.  Experiened users are free to choose other tools to meet their needs.

If you feel that updating this documentation would benefit your co-workers, feel free to [submit a pull request](https://dev.azure.com/clearesultdev/Evolve/_git/Evolve/pullrequests?_a=mine)!
